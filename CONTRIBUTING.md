Not much in terms of guidelines. This is a static page for a podcast. 
If you have any ideas how to improve the UI, or the structure of the repo, go ahead and PR.
I want to add an "About" page somewhere, so so if anyone has ideas where I should put the link to it on the index page that'd be helpful.
